# rqlite-disco
AWS Lambda code for the [rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite) [discovery service](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite-disco/blob/master/DISCOVERY.md), which allows a group of rqlite nodes to automatically form a cluster or, if a cluster already exists, allows a new node to automatically join that cluster.

For a detailed discussion of the design and implementation of this service, check out [this blog post](http://www.philipotoole.com/building-a-cluster-discovery-service-with-aws-lambda-and-dynamodb/).
